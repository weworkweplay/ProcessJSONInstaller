# Hello Process Module

A starting point skeleton from which to build your own Process module. 
Process modules are used primarily for building admin applications and tools.
This module also creates a page in the ProcessWire admin to run itself from.

## How to use this to make your own Process module

To see exactly what this module does, you may want to install it as-is first. 
Then uninstall and follow the instructions below. 

1. Rename the ProcessHello.module file to be Process[YourModuleName].module
2. Change the class name to be Process[YourModuleName]
3. Change the "const pageName" line at the top of the class to be your unique admin page name.
4. Modify and add to this module to make it do what you want. 
5. If your module needs its own CSS and/or JS files, rename those included to be the same as 
   your module name and modify them to do whatever you want. If your module does NOT need 
   CSS and/or JS files then delete them. 
6. Change all the text here to describe your module and update the README.md file.
7. Change the copyright line directly below to have your information.
8. When ready, post your module to GitHub and to modules.processwire.com!
